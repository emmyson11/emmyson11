#  (˶˃⤙˂˶) Hi, I'm Emmy!

**Senior at University of California, Berkeley 🐻**, majoring in Data Science!

** Aspiring Data Scientist, Machine Learning Enthusiast, and Sustainability Advocate**

Right now, I’m focused on projects that explore real-world applications of ML, especially in projects that are community-centered! I’m always looking to learn and improve, and I enjoy working on projects that combine both technical depth and social impact.


## °‧ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 ·｡ Featured Project: Predicting Food Deserts in California  
Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict food deserts across California with 97% accuracy using features like race, income, and transportation access. The goal was to uncover patterns of food insecurity and support more targeted community interventions.  

**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

**Result**: A significant insight we’ve learned is that food deserts aren’t caused by a single factor, they emerge from the intersection of poverty, racial disparities, and limited access to transportation and healthy food options, highlighting deeper systemic inequalities in communities.

## ⋅˚₊‧ ଳ ‧₊˚ ⋅ Other Projects:
A few other noteworthy projects I’ve worked on:

### College Match Recommender @ Resolvely  
Built a machine learning model to recommend colleges based on student profiles. Used clustering and regression to estimate admissions likelihood and improve user experience.  
**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, Snowflake  
**Outcome**: Achieved 88% R² and improved model fit over baseline.

### Cafe Recommendation App  
Created an AI-powered cafe recommendation system using LangChain, OpenAI, and Yelp API. Users can input natural language queries to get personalized suggestions.  
**Tools**: LangChain, ChromaDB, OpenAI, Yelp API, Streamlit  
**Focus**: Semantic search, RAG pipelines, user experience

#  (˶˃⤙˂˶) Hi, I'm Emmy!

**Senior at University of California, Berkeley 🐻**, majoring in Data Science!

** Aspiring Data Scientist, Machine Learning Enthusiast, and Sustainability Advocate**

Right now, I’m focused on projects that explore real-world applications of ML, especially in projects that are community-centered! I’m always looking to learn and improve, and I enjoy working on projects that combine both technical depth and social impact.

## How To Access My Projects !!

This GitHub account hosts all of my projects related to data analysis and machine learning. You can explore them in two main repositories: Data Analysis Projects, which focuses on exploratory analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling, and Machine Learning Projects, which includes predictive modeling, classification, regression, and end-to-end ML pipelines. I also have projects in the works that you can view with more detail on how wto access under the repository structure below!

## °‧ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 ·｡ Featured Project: Predicting Food Deserts in California  
Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict food deserts across California with 97% accuracy using features like race, income, and transportation access. The goal was to uncover patterns of food insecurity and support more targeted community interventions.  

**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

**Result**: A significant insight we’ve learned is that food deserts aren’t caused by a single factor, they emerge from the intersection of poverty, racial disparities, and limited access to transportation and healthy food options, highlighting deeper systemic inequalities in communities.

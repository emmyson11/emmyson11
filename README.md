#  (À∂ÀÉ‚§ôÀÇÀ∂) Hi, I'm Emmy!

**Senior at University of California, Berkeley üêª**, majoring in Data Science!

Hello, my name is Emmy Son, and I am a first-generation college student at UC Berkeley studying data science. My love for data began from late-night League of Legends games wwith friends where I would dig into stats on OP.GG to figure out the best competitive advantages against my opponents. Naturally, that curiosity drove me to start my career in data science deleving into building predictive models and analyzing real-world datasets.

Since then, I‚Äôve worked on projects ranging from ADHD risk prediction with fMRI and socio-demographic data, to mapping food deserts, to predicting player rank in League, turning messy data into actionable insights and interpretable models. Outside of coding, I love all things coffee, matcha, and Rilakkuma. I like to think of myself as someone who‚Äôs curious, scrappy, and persistent. If you're interested in netwowrking, collabing on a project, or even becoming friends, please reach out to me!!

## How To Access My Projects !!

This GitHub account hosts all of my projects related to data analysis and machine learning. You can explore them in two main repositories: Data Analysis Projects, which focuses on exploratory analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling, and Machine Learning Projects, which includes predictive modeling, classification, regression, and end-to-end ML pipelines. I also have projects in the works that you can view with more detail on how wto access under the repository structure below!

## ¬∞‚Äß ìÜù ìÜü ìÜû ¬∑ÔΩ° Featured Project: Predicting Food Deserts in California  
Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict food deserts across California with 97% accuracy using features like race, income, and transportation access. The goal was to uncover patterns of food insecurity and support more targeted community interventions.  

**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

**Result**: A significant insight we‚Äôve learned is that food deserts aren‚Äôt caused by a single factor, they emerge from the intersection of poverty, racial disparities, and limited access to transportation and healthy food options, highlighting deeper systemic inequalities in communities.
